							<span style="margin">Chelsea comes to the team after just completing her own swimming career with the Northeastern University Varsity Women's Swim Team.<br />
								<br />
								Originally from Winnetka, California, Chelsea participated in 8 different sports before her love for the water solely committed her to swimming. She competed in a summer league for 12 years and for a USA swim team for nine. During this time, Chelsea qualified and competed in both the Summer and Spring Junior Olympic meets, where she placed on 3 separate occasions. Additionally, Chelsea has also competed in the Arena Grand Prix series, and qualified for Sectional Championships as well as the Janet Evans Invitational.<br />
								<br />
							In 2009, Chelsea decided to continue her swimming career as a sprint freestyler for the Huskies. During her time on the team, she aided the Huskies in numerous successes. Most recently, these include an 8-7 record (which ended in a 5 meet winning streak) and a 5th place finish at the CAA Swimming &amp; Diving Championships during the 2012-2013 season.</span>
