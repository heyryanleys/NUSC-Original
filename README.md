# Original Northeastern University Swim Club Website

A site I built with <a href="https://github.com/Chaviland7">Chaviland7</a> in college for our swim club. It was coded over many late nights with many beers and pizzas-- it's a wonder it worked to begin with but we're trying to help it see the light of day again.
